		Uniplate is library for writing simple and concise generic operations.
		Uniplate has similar goals to the original Scrap Your Boilerplate work,
		but is substantially simpler and faster. The Uniplate manual is available at

		Most users should start by importing this module.
		
		* &quot;Data.Generics.Uniplate.Direct&quot; - a replacement for &quot;Data.Generics.Uniplate.Data&quot;
		with substantially higher performance (around 5 times), but requires writing
		instance declarations.
