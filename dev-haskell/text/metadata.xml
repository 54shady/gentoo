		An efficient packed, immutable Unicode text type (both strict and
		lazy), with a powerful loop fusion optimization framework.
		
		The &#39;Text&#39; type represents Unicode character strings, in a time and
		space-efficient manner. This package provides text processing
		capabilities that are optimized for performance critical use, both
		in terms of large data quantities and high speed.
		
		The &#39;Text&#39; type provides character-encoding, type-safe case
		conversion via whole-string case conversion functions. It also
		provides a range of functions for converting &#39;Text&#39; values to and from
		&#39;ByteStrings&#39;, using several standard encodings.
