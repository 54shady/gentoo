  <impact type="high">
    <p>A BGP peer could send a Route-Refresh message with specially-crafted ORF
      record, which can cause Quagga's bgpd to crash or possibly execute
      arbitrary code with the privileges of the user running Quagga's bgpd; a
      BGP update AS path request with unknown AS type, or malformed
      AS-Pathlimit or Extended-Community attributes could lead to Denial of
      Service (daemon crash), an error in bgpd when handling AS_PATH attributes
      within UPDATE messages can
      be exploited to cause a heap-based buffer overflow resulting in a crash
      of the
      daemon and disruption of IPv4 routing, two errors in ospf6d and ospfd can
      each be exploited to crash the daemon and
