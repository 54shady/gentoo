    <p>
    Ludwig Nussel from SUSE Linux has identified two vulnerabilities in
    GNUMP3d. GNUMP3d fails to properly check for the existence of
    /tmp/index.lok before writing to the file, allowing for local
    unauthorized access to files owned by the user running GNUMP3d. GNUMP3d
    also fails to properly validate the "theme" GET variable from CGI
    input, allowing for unauthorized file inclusion.
    </p>
  </description>
  <impact type="normal">
    <p>
    An attacker could overwrite files owned by the user running GNUMP3d by
    symlinking /tmp/index.lok to the file targeted for overwrite. An
    attacker could also include arbitrary files by traversing up the
    directory tree (at most two times, i.e. "../..") with the "theme" GET
    variable.
    </p>
  </impact>
  <workaround>
    <p>
    There is no known workaround at this time.
